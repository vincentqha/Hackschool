                    Hello! I'm a cognitive science student at UCLA. 
                    I strive to use code as an avenue to build products that communicate compelling stories. <a class="link-highlight" href=https://www.edscapadegames.com>click here to check out the company I work for!</a> I built this website to showcase all of the skills I'm learning through Hackschool + Bloom!

                <p>
                    Having experienced the vibrant escape room culture in Southern California, my friends and I were left dissatisfied with the escape rooms in the Bay Area. 
                    <br></br> 
                    <br>"What if we started our own escape room?" That's when ambition struck at 110%.</br>
                    <br></br>
                    This project has been in the works for 2+ years and we launched it the summer of 2020. We designed the games, we built the mechanisms, and we turned an idea into a tangible space where we're able to share our passion with the community. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I initially had the idea to build this website as a showcase for all the skills I learned through Hackschool and Bloom but I started building this project over the Week 9 weekend, so I'm not complete yet.
                    With time constraints, I eventually decided to build this webpage to advertise a business I started this summer with my friends.
                    <br></br>
                    During winter break, I plan to continue watching the workshops on YouTube and building the website by my original plan.
